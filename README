The ramdisk.sh shell script included in this project may
be used to create a ramdisk on OS X (probably other Unix
based systems as well).

A short screencast has been recorded which demonstrates
usage of the script.  The screencast is available at
http://s3.amazonaws.com/jeffscreencasts/ramdisk.mov.
